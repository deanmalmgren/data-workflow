The goal of these examples is to illustrate the various features of
`flo` and to demonstrate working examples for using `flo` "in the
wild". Users are encouraged to
[contribute examples](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/flo/issues/new)
as a means to demonstrate the capability of `flo` or to illustrate a
feature request that they would like to see added to the package.

Some of these examples are used for [functional testing](../tests/) of
the code and they may be used for other things in the future.
