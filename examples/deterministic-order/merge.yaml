# The result of this example should be run in alphabetical order
#
# This example demonstrates how multiple dependencies are
# handled. Task data/converging/d depends on task data/converging/a
# and data/converging/c. Since data/converging/c is further from the
# source (data/converging/a), data/converging/d must occur after
# data/converging/c.
#
# Experiment with this example by changing the order of tasks to see
# how it impacts the order in which they are run by running
#
#     flo run --config merge.yaml
