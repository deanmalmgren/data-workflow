# The result of this example should be run in alphabetical order
#
# This example demonstrates how graph dependencies are *always*
# respected, but that sibling tasks data/siblings/{b,c,d} are run in
# the order in which they appear in the YAML file.
#
# Experiment with this example by changing the order of tasks to see
# how it impacts the order in which they are run by running
#
#     flo run --config sibling.yaml
