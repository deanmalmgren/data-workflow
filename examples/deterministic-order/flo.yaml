# this example is used to validate that the task graph is always
# traversed in a deterministic order. Task graphs are always iterated
# over based on their dependencies, but ties are broken based on the
# ordering in this file, the final order should be:
#   a
#   z
#   e
#   g
#   b
#   c
#   d
#   j
#   k
#   l
#   f
#   y
