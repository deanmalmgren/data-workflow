The purpose of this example is to demonstrate that `flo` works well
with large data sets. In this case, extracting the RGB values for a
bunch of pictures ends up creating a few gigabytes of data, which
isn't
[ginormous or anything](https://github.com/datascopeanalytics/dix),
but certainly provides a reasonable way to test the performance of flo
for larger data sets.
